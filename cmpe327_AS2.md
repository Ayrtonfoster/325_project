## Project Structure

## Method Outline

## Style Guide
PEP:8 is the chosen style and syntax that will be followed by the developers of this project. It was chosen because of its wide use and non-specificity towards any corporations.
Developers have setup their IDE's to perform automatic formatting inspections where error will be highlighted. The use of a defined style guide will speed up debugging, increasing clarity, and reducing time required for code inspections.

A link to the full style guide outline can be found here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ 
## Test Plan
### Test Organization
Unit Tests: Based on the requirement sub-lists R1 to R8 with mirrored tests for both front and back end. Front end tests will use mocking for backend requirements and vise-versa.
 
unit tests based on R groupings, integration tests based around the buy sell features, system testing using user stories
### Tools and Techniques
Automated tests will be run using the ```pytest``` command prior to each commit. The automated tests will be pulled from ```qa327_test``` folder which will be organized as outlined in "Test Organization".
